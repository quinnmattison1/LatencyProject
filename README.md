# LatencyProject

I completed this project as a part of the Introduction to Software Development, CS:2820, course. I was tasked to complete a series of assignments to develop skills in a broad range of areas in software development.  

The project utilizes [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) as the IDE and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) for version control.  

## Project Breakdown  

### HW0  

Learned to use GitLab for cloning repositories and Eclipse for Java development. Imported the professor's base code repository to be built upon in later assignments.   

### HW1   

Created a `main` function in `WorkloadDescription.java` that sorts flows in reverse alphabetical order.  

### HW2    

Added Javadoc comments including:  

- Summary comments   
- Attribute comments  
- Method comments     

For the following classes:     

- `Warp.java`  
- `VisualizationObject.java`      
- `VisualizationImplementation.java`  
- `LatencyAnalysis.java`  
- `Flow.java`   
- `Workload.java`    
- `Program.java`  

### HW3  

Wrote and executed JUnit test methods for functions in:     

- `Workload.java`  
- `Program.java`   
- `LatencyAnalysis.java`   

### HW4    

Created UML diagrams for:    

- `LatencyVisualization.java`  
- `LatencyAnalysis.java`  

### HW5   

Refactored constructors and methods in `LatencyAnalysis.java`:      

- Constructors   
- `latencyReport()`  
- `buildLatencyReport()`     

## Conclusion     

This project provided me with hands-on experience in source control, IDEs, documentation, testing, design, and refactoring in Java. By completing this project, I developed core software engineering competencies.
